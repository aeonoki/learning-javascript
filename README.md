# learning-javascript
24.07.2025

Hi! I'm aeonoki.

My goal is to become a frontend developer and this repository is the beginning of my journey. Today I start learning JavaScript.

In this repository I will be doing exercises from the [**JavaScript course**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerdGm-ehJQ) by [**SuperSimpleDev**](https://github.com/SuperSimpleDev). Thanks a lot to him.

P.S. Also, this is my first time using Github. Kinda nervous :P
